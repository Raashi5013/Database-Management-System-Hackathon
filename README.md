Database-Management-System-Hackathon
Animal Shelter Management System is a comprehensive database-driven application developed. This project was built as part of a DBMS hackathon to model real-world shelter operations including pet intake, adoption workflows, and volunteer scheduling.

Designed with relational database principles, the system manages complex relationships between animals, adopters, adoption records, and volunteers. Key features include an ER diagram and relational schema capturing pet health, vaccination, and adoption status; recursive queries to detect volunteers working on consecutive days; and stored procedures for finalizing adoptions. The project also includes user-defined functions for health scoring of pets, triggers for volunteer audit logging, and demonstration of transaction isolation to ensure data consistency under concurrent access.

This project showcases advanced SQL functionalities including triggers, stored procedures, recursive queries, user-defined functions, and federated storage engines. It highlights the practical use of MySQL to handle real-time adoption data syncing across remote databases, enforce business logic, and optimize decision-making. The system is scalable, reliable, and provides insights into the shelter's operations, ensuring both animal welfare and volunteer coordination are efficiently managed.

Built using MySQL, this project emphasizes data integrity, real-time synchronization, and modular database designâ€”making it a strong demonstration of applied DBMS concepts in a real-world context.
